# arpilisp

Do you know how to implement a Lisp interpreter? Neither did I until I did. This is the result.

Arpilisp is a Lisp interpreter for the Raspberry Pi. It uses assembly, the lowest level language, to implement an interpreter for Lisp, the highest level language.  Arpilisp implements Lisp from scratch, with no help from any libraries and minimal help from the kernel.

It's all in a single, commented assembly file, ready to build, use, extend, and hack.

To get started you can either download [arpilisp.s](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcpaq/arpilisp/master/arpilisp.s) directly or clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/marcpaq/arpilisp`

Instructions for building and using are in the file.

Feedback is welcome and encouraged.

Enjoy.
